                I have always been interested in computer programs in general, but did not begin to become academically aware of these programs until senior year of high school. I was enrolled in a class that covered the coding language of C++ during my senior year for two months before having to drop it because I was enrolled in too many college classes while in high school. Upon graduating from Berkeley High School and becoming a student at Santa Barbara City College, my incentive toward reaching my goals in computer science seem to become unreachable due to the rigorous requirements presented to attain the undergraduate degree. In search of how I could adjust, but still explore my interests and expand my knowledge in the computer science field, the development of virtual reality that Valve and Facebook were moving towards appeared to be a career direction to examine. Therefore I enrolled into CS 105 Theory and Practice in Santa Barbara City College to begin the process of once again building my computer science knowledge. Then I was introduced to a Web Development Certificate Program ran by Antioch University which pointed me towards many opportunities and ultimately towards Christina Hart, the founder of Lash Girl Club. Christina selected me along many other developers to create and work on box-subscription e-commerce web application called Lash Girl Club. Upon being selected to work on Lash Girl Club, I've realized the vastness of computer science and the ever-increasing speeds of production towards new technology, therefore I am always expanding and improving my knowledge on different technologies.
