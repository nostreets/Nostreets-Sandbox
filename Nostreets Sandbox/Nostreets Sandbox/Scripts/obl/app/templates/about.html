                I had a computer in my life since I was two years old and have been intrigued by it ever since. That had led me to develop this interest towards computers, gaming, and technology in general. Plus, ever since birth I’ve been raised by two very independent very outgoing entrepreneurs.  My mom has always made progress towards any of her aspirations no matter what obstacle got in her way. My dad on the other hand was very serious and busy when it came to work because of the successful he was acquiring at that time. These qualities of my parents is what ultimately helped me develop my current goals and aspirations. I have always been interested in computer programs in general, but did not begin to become academically aware of these programs until senior year of high school.

                I was enrolled in a class that covered the coding language of C++ during my senior year for two months before having to drop it because I was enrolled in too many college classes while in high school. Upon graduating from Berkeley High School and becoming a student at Santa Barbara City College, my incentive toward reaching my goals in computer science seem to become unreachable due to the rigorous requirements presented to attain the undergraduate degree. Therefore, I had this interest that I was discouraged to go through with and learn more about it because of all of the requirements it takes to progress in a computer science degree. Because of this discouragement I really did not have the passion to progress in the field of computer science and changed my major to Communications. Although I was working towards my communication major and was interested in public speaking in general I was not a fan of the classes, so in search of how I could adjust, but still explore my interests and expand my knowledge in the computer science field, my friend introduce me to the development of virtual reality. He had just got his Vive by Valve and let me try it out for a couple of hours. When I did it immediately rekindled my passion for computer science and my mind was feeling up with ideas for the future. Therefore I enrolled into CS 105 Theory and Practice last semester to begin the process of once again building my  computer science knowledge.

                The Web Development Certificate Program was introduced to me as a result of both my mom being an active graduate student at Antioch University Los Angeles and thereby was informed by her financial advisor Kaitlin Evans of the program, paired with her being aware of my computer science and technology interests. Upon finding out more information on the program requirements, meeting with Robert Fox, touring the campus, and going to the orriation, I decided to enroll into the program. Thus I studied vigorously to make sure I would not be left behind in the upcoming classes to come, and they came and passed before I could take a breather. Therefore I learned a great deal that will greatly help my current ideas and future ideas and can display and vocalize these newly learned skills in a professional manner.
